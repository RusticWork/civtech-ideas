# Tech for Local Community

This repo is to house ideas, discussions, playbooks for how to build small, tech-first communities in India's hinterlands. Learn from the best across the globe
but apply it in your local community where you can immediately see the impact you can make

# Ideas to get you thinking

- You've done some crazy computer vision projects that tag friends. Why not help the local coffee plant to use the same tech to pick the best berries ?
- Help make products in your local store more discoverable (and deliverable)
- Health monitor for ageing parents from children who had to move away - use your knowledge of app building and using health APIs
- Learnt calculus on the fly for the task you had to code up in a day but would love to give high school kids the material they deserve ?

Happy to hear your ideas - [please propose your idea]() and if you do know how to implement them, we are more than happy to see you take the lead as well.

# Implementation

These projects are democratic and volunteer driven. Our strength is in numbers. Hopefully with the guidance of more experienced mentors (who can be across the globe), we can inspire and bring in a local-community tech culture.

# Local communities

Following are the list of local communities we are looking to serve -

| Town                          | Description                                 | Communication platform |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Virudhunagar](wikipedia-vnr) | A small district in the south of Tamil Nadu | Discord                |

- If you would like to lead your town's effort, please contact [Sriram]() - we will make all our resources available soon.

# Why

At RusticWork, [our mission](https://www.rusticwork.in/post/why-now) is to usher in a new technology driven development of smaller towns (in India) that have historically had poor access to capital and talent. The talent could not stay back because of job demands, but with Work From Home (WFH) proving to be a solution for many worker

Read [here] and [here] to understand . There is a frightening amount of inequality between cities and towns/villages and it wont end well for either if we allow the status quo (pre-2020) to continue.

- This is part of RusticWork's community initiative. You can support [RusticWork](https://rusticwork.in) directly by patronizing their [unique co-working spaces](https://app.rusticwork.in) and [letting your companies know about it](https://www.rusticwork.in/company-letter).

This is all very new to us and if you have any experience building communities before (or know someone who does), we'd love to hear tips from you. Thanks for stopping by.
