This repo is to house ideas, discussions, playbooks for how to build small, tech-first local (geographical) communities in India's hinterlands. Learn from the best across the globe but apply it in your local community where you can immediately see the impact you can make.  Be the change you wish to see.

## Ideas to get you thinking

- You've done some crazy computer vision projects that tag friends. Why not help the local coffee plant to use the same tech to pick the best berries ?
- Help make products in your local store more discoverable (and deliverable)
- Health monitor for ageing parents from children who had to move away - use your knowledge of app building and using health APIs
- Learnt [calculus on the fly from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM) for the task you had to code up in a day ? Share that with high school kids who don't have a clue just like you

Happy to hear your ideas - [please propose your idea](https://github.com/RusticWork/civtech-ideas/issues/new/choose) and if you do know how to implement them, we are more than happy to see you take the lead as well.

## Implementation

These projects are volunteer driven. Our strength is in numbers. Hopefully with the guidance of more experienced mentors (who can be across the globe), we can inspire and bring in a local-community driven tech culture.

## Local communities

Following are the list of local communities we are looking to serve -

| Town                          | Description                                 | Communication platform |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Virudhunagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virudhunagar) | A small district in the south of Tamil Nadu best known for India's greatest Chief Minister (Kamaraj) | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FwsjGNV5AS) |

- If you would like to lead your town's effort, please contact the maintainers - we will organize all our resources better and make it opensource soon.

## Why

At RusticWork, [our mission](https://www.rusticwork.in/post/why-now) is to usher in a new technology driven development of smaller towns (in India) that have historically had poor access (or drain) to capital and talent. The talent could not stay back because of job demands, but with Work From Home (WFH) proving to work, we have a unique opportunity to reverse urban migration and improve the economic viability of smaller towns.

Read [here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1277025421305905152.html) and [here](https://zenx.medium.com/the-six-dots-problem-re-imagining-india-b7d81b223827) to understand the depth of the problem. There is a frightening amount of inequality between cities and towns/villages and it wont end well for either if we allow the status quo (pre-2020) to continue.

You can support [RusticWork](https://rusticwork.in) directly by patronizing their [unique co-working spaces](https://app.rusticwork.in) and [letting your companies know about it](https://www.rusticwork.in/company-letter).

This is all very new to us and if you have any experience building communities before (or know someone who does), we'd love to hear tips from you. Thanks for stopping by.
